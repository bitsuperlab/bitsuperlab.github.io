<p>DPOS Super Lab is to join the competition of DPOS mining, because providing good service as a stable DPOS delegate is a challeging work, and could be very interesting and profitable.</p>

<p>Two goals:</p>

<ol>
<li> Act as one of the 100 delegate mining nodes, and keep stable with high reputation, 100% online.</li>
<li> Testing DPOS network, reseach on all kinds of attack and cheating possibility. Find the flaw of other 99 mining nodes.</li>
</ol>

<p>Three Principles:</p>
<ol>
<li> Bitsuperlab will only host up to 2 *active* third party delegates except Bitsuperlab, but unlimited positions for stand by delegates. </li>
<li> If there is > 2 delegates becomes active, we will choose to keep only 2 delegates of them, others have to go independent, don't worry we will provide enough technical support for your migration util you are happy to run independently.</li>
<li> Bitsuperlab will provide comprehensive consultant to your delegates here, our goal is to be the incubator of industry-level delegates for Bitshares community.</li>

<p>Quote from <a href="https://bitsharestalk.org/index.php?topic=4124.msg51795#msg51795">DPOS Mining Delegate Requirements</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Becoming a delegate requires:</p>

<ol>
<li>Ability to run provided software on a low-latency connection<br>
</li>
<li>Ability to setup a secure linux environment </li>
<li>Ability to get 1% of the vote...

<ul>
<li>unique geographic location</li>
<li>trusted member of the community</li>
<li>1000 BIPS  (a couple of PTS or AGS) registration fee... (keep out spammers)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Remaining a delegate requires:</p>

<pre><code>  + low latency, 99.9% uptime
  + non-discrimination of valid transactions
  + better reputation than all but the top 99
</code></pre>

<p>How to earn the best reputation:</p>

<pre><code>  + Provide the most additional services for your pay.

        - seed node supporting thousands of connections
        - block explorers
        - free web wallets
        - high speed blockchain downloads

  + Provide the most proof as to your transparency 
</code></pre>

<p>You get the idea... who ever is willing to provide the most service for their pay will likely win over someone attempting to provide the least service.  </p>
